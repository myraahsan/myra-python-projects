## Incidents of gun violence in the US
As part of CareerFoundry's Data Analysis course, I conducted an analysis in Python on the incidents of gun violence that took place between January 2013 to March 2018. 

### Objectives
The primary objective of my analysis was to conduct an initial data exploration and exploratory analysis on a subset of relevant data to gain valuable insights into the increasing incidents of gun violence in the United States. Through rigorous data exploration and analysis, I sought to uncover meaningful patterns, correlations and associations within the dataset.

### Tools
The project used Excel, Python and Tableau. The following libraries were used in Python:

Pandas

Numpy

Seaborn

Matplotlib

Pyplot

Scipy
